                </h3>

                ReactJS: The core of this website is built with ReactJS, a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for
                building user interfaces. React allows for efficient updates and rendering of components, ensuring a
                smooth and responsive user experience.

                JavaScript: As the backbone of modern web development, JavaScript plays a crucial role in the
                functionality and interactivity of this site. From DOM manipulation to asynchronous operations,
                JavaScript ensures that everything works seamlessly.

                CSS and HTML: To ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly design, I have utilized CSS and HTML
                extensively. CSS frameworks and pre-processors like SASS have been employed to maintain a clean and
                scalable codebase.

                Other Web Technologies:
                - Node.js: For server-side operations and API integrations.
                - Express.js: To handle routing and middleware for backend services.
                - MongoDB: As a NoSQL database for storing and managing data efficiently.
                - Git and GitHub: For version control and collaboration, ensuring the codebase remains organized and
                accessible.<br/>
